# My Portfolio (WIP)
A portfolio of my recent works in Native Android App Development (Whose owners are fine with including them publicly) starting by 2022 (as older works do not really support the newest Android versions). I always follow the motto of: Compatibility, Stability, Efficiency, and Creativity.

## NOTE:
The works published here are just for showcase only. They are protected under their own respective licenses and therefore, the owners will be notified and go after any illegal use.

## Little Background:
- I am a 25 year old developer who graduated from Algiers' Superior School of Informatics and Computer Science. I currently study Dentistry as my second degree, and do Freelancing online as a hustle.
- I have **6 years** of experience (Since 2016) in Android App development.
- **_I master the following languages_**: Java, Kotlin, Python, JavaScript, C, Objective-C, C#, C++, Ruby, Lua, vJASS
- _I am currently learning the following languages_: Carbon - GodotScript - Assembly
- I have solo-developed **•75•** apps, co-developed and enhanced almost a hundred, and build/fixed/enhanced countless libraries so far.
- Coding _**is not**_ a challenge. Programming languages are just like normal languages, you're just talking to the machine.
- **Other Skills**: 3D Design - 2D Design - Software and System Engineering - Hardware Engineering - Music Composition
