# My Portfolio (WIP)
A portfolio of my recent works (Whose owners are fine with including them publicly) starting by 2022 (as older works do not really support the newest Android versions). I always follow the motto of: Compatibility, Stability, Efficiency, and Creativity.

## NOTE:
The works published here are just for showcase only. They are protected under their own respective licenses and therefore, the owners will be notified and go after any illegal use.

## Little Background:
- I am a 25 year old developer who graduated from Algiers' Superior School of Informatics and Computer Science. I currently study Dentistry as my second degree, and do Freelancing online as a hustle.
- I have 6 years of experience (Since 2016) in Android App development.
- I master the following languages: Java - Kotlin - Python - JavaScript - C - ObjectiveC - C# - C++ - Ruby - Lua - vJASS
- I am currently learning the following languages: Carbon - GodotScript - Assembly
- I have solo-developed •75• apps, co-developed almost a hundred, and almost built a hundred libraries so far.
- Coding is not a challenge. Programming languages are just like normal languages, you're just talking to the machine.
- Other Skills: 3D Design - 2D Design - Software and System Engineering - Hardware Engineering - Music Composition
